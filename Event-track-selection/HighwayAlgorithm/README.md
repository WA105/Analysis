In order to run the highway yourself, copy the files "swiss_highway.ipynb" and "swiss_highway_data_2018_jun_24_reco_functions.py" to your CERNBox. Then open the ipynb script in SWAN and specify the runs you want the highway to run over in the "run_list".

The default settings (which you can all change in the .ipynb script) are:
minimum track length: 20 cm
small rectangle width: 3.5 cm
large rectangle width: 10 cm
minimum box length (in case of multiple boxes): 50 cm
maximum number of tracks in event: 10000000 (effectively infinity)
