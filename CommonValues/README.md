**ADC to charge converstion:** use 55 (ADC x ticks)/fC for view 0 and 67 (ADC x ticks) /fC for view 1.
This is based on charge injection in the range of 14-150 fC during cold operation of the detector. See presentation from July 6th-2018 on indico. 

**Electron lifetime**: use a common value of 7 ms. This is based on best fit to most of the data (see below) and presentation from June 29th-2018 on indico.

**Monte Carlo**: 

-electron lifetime of 7 ms

-Gain: center LEM gains of 4, the corner LEMs (LEMs 1,3,10,12) are set to a gain of 2
